# Contributing to Studio Bookings

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Studio Bookings as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes, if applicable.
3. The PR should work for the latest version of Next.js.
4. Ensure all tests pass, if applicable.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/studio-bookings/issues/new); it's that easy!
